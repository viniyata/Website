                            An observable, microscopic aquarium module, a tiny ecosystem of living microorganisms, algae, and tardigrades that users could view through their phone screen. The module is a provocation that asks users to bring mindfulness to their relationship with their phones. We carry them around with us all day, they lay next to us in bed, and they are the first thing we see when we wake up. When the phone is misplaced or injured, we feel a genuine emotional loss, as if it was a living entity.
